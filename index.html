        <p>Hi,</p>

        <p>Hope you're doing alright.</p>

        <p>Were you silently enjoying my jumbled behaviour?<br>
        Oh yes — you must have been.</p>

        <p>I took the step and apologized, even for things that were unintentional — not because I was wrong, but because I valued the connection and didn’t want to leave things unsaid.<br>
        You simply said “ok” and went silent… ignored my messages.</p>

        <p>I don’t believe in leaving things incomplete, unclear, or unspoken.<br>
        There should at least be a proper closure.<br>
        But you saw everything and still chose silence.<br>
        No reply. No block. No explanation.</p>

        <p>That kind of silence doesn’t feel mature — it reflects a lack of accountability.</p>

        <p>I reached out genuinely — not out of weakness or desperation — but simply expecting a small conversation.<br>
        Instead, it felt like you were passively enjoying the attention… the “sorry,” the “please,” the follow requests.</p>

        <p>Yes, I’m an emotional person. I believe in expressing and resolving, which is why I reached out to you in the first place.<br>
        I invested my mental peace in someone who was a stranger — just assuming you, too, had a kind heart.</p>

        <p>But I was wrong.<br>
        I’m done now. And I choose to protect my self-respect.<br>
        Someone like you doesn’t even deserve the clarity and effort I gave.</p>

        <p>Anyway, silence suits people who find silence easier than owning their actions.<br>
        You keep your silence — I’ll keep my self-respect.</p>

        <p>Wish you all the best.</p>

        <p class="signature">Regards,<br>PNS</p>
